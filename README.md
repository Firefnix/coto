Theoretical research, experiments and implementation of _abstract additive quantum decision diagrams_, as part of a student research project.

## Building

To build the project, you must have Clang, CMake and Ninja installed. The code uses some C++23 features, so a recent version of `clang++` is required. *Other versions probably work*, but I personally use the following on my machine:
* Clang 19.1.6
* CMake 3.31.3
* Ninja 1.12.1

1. Configure the project
```bash
export CXX=$(which clang++)
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja
```
2. Build the project
```bash
cmake --build build
```
3. To run the tests (optional)
```bash
cd build
ctest
```

## QASM interactive interpreter

After building the project (steps 1. and 2. above), simply run `./build/prompt`. You can then enter QASM instructions, for example
```
qubit a;
qubit b;
h a;
p(pi/3) b;
cx a b;
h b;
```

This prompt utility comes with a few available **run statements** that should be `;`-terminated:
* `@build`, `@inst`, `@instantiate` - create a new diagram
* `@run`, `@sim`, `@simulate` - simulate the current diagram
* `@list`, `@actions` - list the actions (gate applicaitons) to be performed
* `@display`, `@evaluate`, `@eval` - display the evaluation of the current diagram
* `@describe`, `@desc` - display the description of the current diagram
* `@help`, `@man`, `@manual` - display a help message

Applying gates to qubits is not performed immediately after the statement is entered, and should be triggered by a `@run;`.

The `prompt` executable can also take a `.qasm` file path as an argument, in this case it quits after executing all statements in the file, without entering interactive mode.

## Repository architecture

Presentation of this repository's main directories:
-  `.github/workflows` GitHub actions continuous integration (CI) and continous deployment (CD) configuration files
    - Runs the unit tests that are in the `test` directory and marked as ready for testing in `CMakeLists.txt`
    - Generate the docs using Doxygen and publish them to [firefnix.github.io/coto](https://firefnix.github.io/coto/) using GitHub Pages
-  `archives` Legacy documents or code, that still should be indexed
-  `doc` Theory documents (basically, LaTeX)
-  `include` Code header files (`.h` C++ files)
-  `ref` References, code or case studies that can be used as examples
-  `s6` Final report and presentation for semester 6 (in French)
-  `s7` Final report and presentation for semester 6 (in French)
-  `src` Source code (`.cpp` C++ files, not headers)
-  `test` Test code (`.cpp` C++ files)
